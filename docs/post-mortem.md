## What is a "post-mortem"?

Post-mortem documents are where we step back and evaluate how we did during the
just-completed season: what went well, what went poorly, and so on.

The purpose of these documents is to reflect on how we can improve for next year.

A key component of these documents is that they are **blameless**. No individuals are
called out for mistakes because "we" as a team are responsible for our successes and
our failures.

These documents also end with a set of **Action Items**, which are concrete actions that
we can perform to ensure that we don't make similar mistakes in the future.
